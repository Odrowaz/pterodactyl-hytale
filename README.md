## 🛠 Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Import the Egg JSON into your Pterodactyl panel
3. Create a new server using the **Hytale Egg**
4. Ensure the following settings are used:


/auth login device

AFTER YOU HAVE VERIFIED YOUR SERVER DO: /auth persistence Encrypted

## 🔐 Authentication (Required)

On the **first startup**, the Hytale server requires OAuth authentication.

### Step 1: Login

Run the following command in the **server console**:

```yaml
/auth login device
```


Follow the instructions shown:
1. Open the provided URL
2. Enter the device code
3. Complete login in your browser

⚠️ **Do not restart the server while authentication is in progress.**

---

### Step 2: Enable Authentication Persistence (IMPORTANT)

After you have **successfully verified and logged into the server**, run this command **once**:
```yaml
/auth persistence encrypted
```

This will:
- Securely store authentication credentials
- Persist authentication across restarts
- Prevent repeated OAuth login prompts

⚠️ **If this step is skipped, authentication may be lost after a restart.**
